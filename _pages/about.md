I am deeply motivated by the application of deep learning to Earth monitoring. 
Currently, I am in the final year of my Ph.D. at CESBIO in Toulouse, under the supervision of Silvia Valero and Jordi Inglada. 
My PhD focuses on developing foundation models for remote sensing data. In particular, we propose novel self-supervised 
pre-training tasks and relevant deep neural network architectures for Satellite Image Time Series (SITS). 
Our research outputs, including code and datasets, are openly available.

Finally, I am looking for a postdoctoral position in Paris starting in April 2024, where I would like to continue my work on 
integrating deep learning with remote sensing data.
